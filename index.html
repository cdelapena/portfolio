        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>	I'm currently an engineering manager working in the fast-paced Boeing 737 Wing Production line,
          managing a 13-person team responsible for providing repairs to damaged hardware. The production
          line produces 2 sets of Wings per day, comprised of thousands of parts, so working with a sense of urgency is part of the culture.</p>
        <p>Before that, I was an engineering manager in charge of build plan creation and hardware repairs at the Boeing Fabrication
          tube and duct shop, which produces between 900,000 to 1,000,000 parts per year at high velocity.	Before that, I was a lead engineer for a product and
          process improvement, as well as hardware repair team.</p>

	      <p>In each role, I've worked on several projects to improve organizational performance.</p>

	      <p>Due to the pace of my current and most recent positions, I am used to quickly responding to customer concerns
          and resolving novel, production-stopping problems with urgency.</p>
